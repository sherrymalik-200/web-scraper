• Critical meeting:US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet today in Anchorage, Alaska, at 3:30 p.m. ET (11:30 a.m. local time).



• Trump’s stated goal:Trump told reporters on Air Force One en route to Alaska that he wasn’t having the meeting to broker a deal on behalf of Ukraine, but said instead, his goal wasgetting Putin to the table. He also stopped short of promising security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a deal to end the war.



• Ukraine sidelined:Trump has threatened Russia with“very severe consequences”if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war in the meeting, from which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was excluded. If the summit goes well, Trump has suggested organizing a trilateral meeting with Zelensky that may include European leaders who remain deeply wary of Putin.



• A sticking point:Any peace deal would need to involve agreement on territory, with Russia occupying almost a fifth of Ukraine’s land.Here are the key regions that Putin wants.



Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron spoke today, according to the Élysée Palace.



The two leaders agreed to meet “at the moment when it will be the most useful and effective” after the meeting of US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, it added.



Zelensky met this week in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and in London with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.



Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov arrived in Anchorage dressed in an unusually casual combo for a senior diplomat: light blue jeans, a black jacket, and a white sweater boldly emblazoned with “CCCP” — the Cyrillic for “USSR,” the Soviet Union, of which Ukraine was once a part.



Lavrov was tight-lipped about his expectations for the Alaska summit, but his sweater sent a loud message.



The message harks back to Russia’s supposed lost “golden age” as a great power during the Cold War, a bit like a Kremlin’s version of “Make Russia Great Again.”



Russian President Vladimir Putin himself once said the collapse of the Soviet Union was “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.” Trying to revive Russia’s former imperial greatness has become a major aim of his decades-long presidency.



The symbolism of the sweater was not lost on Russian media figures, who were delighted by Lavrov’s choice of attire, framing it as his response to the pro-Ukrainian protesters who gathered in Anchorage to demand Kyiv be given a seat at the table.



Olga Skabeeva, a state television host, shared a picture of Lavrov’s sweater saying: “Lavrov replies. The sweater! USSR! The best!!”



Lavrov’s sweater also shows Russia’s confidence ahead of the summit, which is allowing Moscow to project an image of itself it has long craved: that Russia is once again a great power, unable to be ignored on the international stage.



American support for sending US military aid to Ukraine has climbed sharply since March, with the increase driven largely by Republicans, according to anew poll from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.



The poll, released as President Donald Trump heads to Alaska for a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the conflict in Ukraine, shows rising majorities in favor of the US sending arms and military supplies to Ukraine, 62% now, up 10 points since March, as well as US economic assistance to Ukraine, 61%, up 6 points since March. Support for US assistance to Ukraine on both measures has now returned to about where it was in fall 2023 after declining in 2024 and early 2025.



Support for additional military supplies has climbed most sharply among Republicans — the 51% in support of such assistance now is 21 points higher than the share in favor of it in March. It has increased among independents as well, with 61% support it now, up from 51% in March. Views among Democrats have held largely steady and are broadly in favor of military aid for Ukraine, with 75% favor it now.



The poll also finds Americans largely supportive of increased economic and diplomatic sanctions on Russia in response to the conflict: 73% overall favor that, including broad majorities of Democrats (77%), Republicans (74%) and independents (69%).



Few in the poll, 35%, say they would support sending US troops to Ukraine to help the Ukrainian government defend itself against Russia.



The findings in the survey mirror those of other recent surveys on the conflict, including a Pew Research Center surveyreleased yesterdaywhich found a growing share of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents saying the US has a responsibility to help Ukraine defend itself.



The Chicago Council poll was conducted online July 18 to July 30 among 2,148 adults nationwide. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.



President Donald Trump says he’s not trying to end the Ukraine war — including by meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska — to improve his own life.



“I’m not doing this for my health. OK, I don’t need it,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One as he was heading to Anchorage for the summit. “I’d like to focus on our country, but I’m doing this to save a lot of lives.”



He said the consequences for Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war would be punishing.



“Yes, it will be very severe,” he said of potential economic measures on Moscow.



US President Donald Trump stopped short of promising security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a deal to end the war, saying he was open to the idea but that Europe would have to take the lead.



“Maybe,” he said to reporters on Air Force One en route to Alaska when asked whether the US would put security guarantees on the table.



Trump made clear such measures would not include Ukraine joining NATO.



“Not in the form of NATO,” he said. “There are certain things that aren’t going to happen.”



He said he wasn’t traveling to Alaska to broker a deal on behalf of Ukraine, but said instead his goal was getting Russian President Vladimir Putin to the table.



“I’m not here to negotiate for Ukraine,” he said.



British Defense Minister John Healey said that the United Kingdom is ready to “put boots on the ground” in Ukraine if Russia agrees to a ceasefire following the Alaska summit.



“We are ready to put UK boots on the ground in Ukraine in part to reassure Ukrainians,” Healeytold the BBC, hours before US President Donald Trump is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.



“But also in part to secure the safe skies, safe seas and to build the strength of the Ukrainian forces, because in the end the best deterrence against Russia … re-launching their aggression against Ukraine is the strength of Ukraine to stand for itself,” he said.



Healey’s comments came after the leaders of the UK, France and Germany said on Wednesday that they are willing to play an “active role” in guaranteeing Ukraine’s security “once hostilities have ceased.”



Healey said he hoped the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska could be “the first step towards serious negotiations.”



“Today is a day when really all eyes are on Putin. Is he serious about what he says?” he asked.



The Air Force One flight carrying US President Donald Trump has left Joint Base Andrews, bound for Alaska, where he will hold a crucial summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.



Trump will participate in a bilateral program at 3 p.m. ET and is expected to depart Anchorage back to Washington at 9:45 p.m. ET, according to the White House’s daily guidance.



Russia may have faced a barrage of Western sanctions since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, yet massive military spending and finding new customers for its oil have kept its economy afloat.



Sanctions have targeted Russia’s lucrative energy exports in a bid to squeeze the Kremlin’s finances. The European Union, for example, introduced a ban on seaborne imports of Russian crude oil in late 2022.



Moscow has adapted, re-routing vast quantities of it oil to India and China. Yet US President Donald Trump’s threats to bring in so-called secondary sanctions — additional tariffs placed on buyers of Russian oil — could upend those trading relationships.



India tariffs:Trump hasthreatened to slap a 25% tariffon Indian exports to the US from the end of August as punishment for New Delhi’s trade with Moscow, on top of the 25% levy he imposed last week. India has defended its purchases of Russian oil on the grounds of ensuring energy security for its 1.4 billion-strong population.



But should secondary sanctions eventually pressure buyers of Russian energy to find alternate suppliers, that could deal a significant blow to the Kremlin.



Expectations are high that thesummitbetween US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could be “dramatic,” CNN chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance said, speaking from Alaska.



A potential joint news conference from Trump and Putin — which may or may not be on the cards after their one-on-one meeting — looks set to be an “extraordinary spectacle,” he said.



Chance pointed out that both leaders will go into the meeting with different expectations: Trump will want to focus on bringing an end to the war — something he has pledged to do even prior to taking up his post as US president — while Putin has consistently refused to compromise on his core objectives and wants to take control of all of the Ukrainian territory Russia has annexed.



Putin, Chance said, will also be looking to broaden the agenda during the summit, to discuss commercial issues, space exploration and economic cooperation.



For that reason, the makeup of the Russian delegation includes officials such as Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Chance said.



The large group of advisers US President Donald Trump is bringing with him aboard Air Force One to Alaska could provide a window into the issues up for discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin.



It includes two top economic advisers — Treasury Secretary Scott BessentandCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick— who have been at the center of Trump’s efforts to broker new global trade deals.



While Ukraine is at the center of today’s talks, Russia has said it also wants to discuss improving economic ties. And Putin is also bringing a business delegation in the hopes of turning the discussion to economic matters — and possible business deals.



Bessent’s department is also responsible for enforcing sanctions, while Lutnick’s handles tariffs. Trump has threatened “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war, including possible secondary sanctions on countries importing Russian oil and gas.



The two advisers most responsible for Trump’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are also aboard:Secretary of State Marco Rubioandspecial envoy Steve Witkoff. Of everyone on the plane, Witkoff is the last to have seen Putin;they met last week in Moscow.



CIA Director John Ratcliffewill also travel with Trump. It wasn’t initially clear whether an intelligence official would join the president for the summit, but his presence indicates the level of sensitive discussion that is expected.



Trump has also brought along his top speechwriter,Ross Worthington— although no speech is planned — and his staff secretary,Will Scharf, who manages the documents Trump signs.



A US official told CNN that “all options remain on the table” during President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, including Trump walking out of the meeting if he does not think Putin is serious about making a deal.



On Thursday, Trump alluded to the possibility while speaking to reporters.



“We’re going to find out where everybody stands, and I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes. We tend to find out whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad meeting, and if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly, and if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace in the pretty near future,” Trump said.



The US official noted that the White House was feeling cautiously optimistic about the meeting, and stressed that Trump felt that he needed to be in the room with Putin to assess where his “head” was in terms of a ceasefire.



US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will start the summit with a one-on-one conversation, with the help of interpreters, before continuing talks over a business lunch, according to the Kremlin.



Large US delegation:The White House announced that 16 officials will travel with the president, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and US special envoy Steve Witkoff.



It is not clear who among those officials will be in the room with Russia’s representatives. Last week, Witkoff met Putin for talks at the Kremlin, which paved the way for the Alaska summit.



﻿Russia’s other five negotiators will include:Putin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. The inclusion of officials dealing with economic matters suggests that talking points may go beyond the war.



Notable absence:No officials from Ukraine will be at the summit, despite calls from Kyiv and its European allies for the country to have a seat at the table. Trump has suggested that his goal is to move toward an eventual trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.



US President Donald Trump departed the White House a short time ago, as he heads to Alaska for a crucial summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.



The motorcade is now rolling to Joint Base Andrews, where Trump will fly on Air Force One to Alaska.



“HIGH STAKES!!!” Trumpposted on Truth Social.



Russia’s Ministry of Defense on Friday claimed its forces had captured the town of Oleksandrohrad in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the key strategic city of Pokrovsk.



Kyiv did not immediately respond to Moscow’s claim, which CNN cannot independently verify.



If confirmed, the capture of Oleksandrohrad would suggest Russia is pressing ahead with its strategy to encircle Pokrovsk, rather than launching a full-frontal assault.



Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials conceded that Russian forces had infiltrated its increasingly porous frontlines near the town of Dobropillia, east of Pokrovsk, but said this did not mean that Moscow now controlled that territory.



On Thursday, Ukrainian military staff in the region said the situation near Dobropillia had been “stabilized,” and that Ukraine had sealed off the gaps in its defenses, trapping the small groups of Russian forces behind its frontline.



Protesters waving Ukrainian flags lined the streets of Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday ahead ofthe Trump-Putin summit.



Demonstrators reiterated their support for Kyiv as they questioned US President Donald Trump’s ability to negotiate a deal with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, while others said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should be present at the talks.



Ukrainians rallying outside the US embassy in Kyiv ahead of theTrump-Putin summitcalled for swaps of people, rather than territory swaps, as they expressed feelings of frustration and trepidation.



Around 100 people attended the protest, which came ahead of high-stakes talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, demanding that all remaining prisoners are released.



Reporting from the protest, CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said some of the demonstrators had loved ones who were being held in Russian prisons or had been missing since Moscow occupied Crimea in 2014.



The demonstrators held banners — many of them in English, suggesting they wanted to send a message to the US audience — including one that read “No Land Swap - We Demand PoW Swap for all.”



Organizers also handed in a letter to the embassy, which they hope will be passed on to Trump.



Valentina Vyhinna, 62, joined the protests because her son was taken into Russian captivity fromMariupol’s Azovstal steel plantin May 2022.



“Ukraine needs to be present at the negotiations,” she said. “Trump seems to be walking down a road with two paths — you never know what he will decide. We hope for the best.”



Denys Nerovnyi, 25, was released last month after three years in Russian captivity. “I don’t think Putin and Trump will agree on anything today,” he said.



Another protester, Raisa Kolchena, said some of her relatives are fighting on the front line.



“I think Trump will not help us. He has his own interest,” Kolchena told CNN. “It is very bad that Ukraine is not at the negotiating table. We need to swap people, not swap land.”



The highly-anticipated summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin today is not seen by Ukrainians as a “serious attempt to bring peace,” Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism Lab Nataliya Gumenyuk told CNN.



“There is no sign that the Russian president is willing to stop,” Gumanyuk said, adding that she views one ofPutin’s primary goalsas for the US to “stop any support of Ukraine.”



As for Trump, Gumenyuk said the meeting is seen as an attempt for him to “organize his relations” with Putin.



The Ukrainian journalist continued that Ukrainians cannot ignore the meeting but are not expecting the outcome to be “connected to the end of the war.” They will, however, remain hopeful for any potential deal on the return of prisoners of war.



She added that Ukrainians see an irony to the meeting being held in Alaska, a former Russian colony that was sold to the US in 1867 for $7.2 million.



President Vladimir Putin stopped in Russia’s far eastern region of Magadan while en route to Alaska for his summit with US President Donald Trump on Friday.



Putin is in the city of Magadan for a “full-fledged regional trip,” which includes a visit to an industrial plant and a meeting with the region’s governor, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced earlier today.



“The city is important. Putin has been there many times, even when he was prime minister,” Peskov said, according to state media TASS.



It takes around eight hours to fly from Moscow to Magadan, and then another four from Magadan to Anchorage, Alaska, where the summit is being held.



Due to the time zones Putin is traversing, the Russian president in effect has two Fridays: one in Magadan, with the second to be in Alaska.



US President Donald Trump said he believes Vladimir Putin wants to make peace in Ukraine, and that the Russian president will not “mess around” at their summit today in Alaska.



“We’re gonna find out where everybody stands. And I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes… whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Thursday.



“And if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly. And if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace in the pretty near future,” he warned.



Trump has long claimed that Putin would not have launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 if he had been president, and said Thursday that the war “should have never happened.”



“I think if I weren’t president, he would take over all of Ukraine,” Trump said.



“If I weren’t president, in my opinion, he would much rather take over all of Ukraine. But I am president, and he’s not going to mess around with me.”



Putin has attempted to take all of Ukraine for three-and-a-half years, but has been unable to capture more than around one fifth of its territory, at a cost of more than 1 million Russian casualties, according to the British defense ministry and the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.



The stakes are “very high” for leaders in Europe ahead ofa summitbetween US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, an analyst warned.



Regional lawmakers will watch “from a very anxious distance” later today when Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin convene in Alaska for a high-profile discussion that could change the fate of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.



“For the whole of the European continent, the stakes are very high and the uncertainty immense,” Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN’s Polo Sandoval on Friday.



European politicians who have been entirely iced out of the discussions — including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky — held avirtual summit with Trumpon Wednesday, to “concert their position” and engage the White House, said Gould-Davies.



“The prospect that Trump and Putin, in relative isolation, could reach an agreement that would fundamentally threaten not only Ukrainian, but wider European security, is a great concern,” he said.



“This is not fundamentally a war in Ukraine about territory,” he reflected. “Russia’s wider ambition is to subordinate the whole of Ukraine (to Russian control) — and then in due course using that as a springboard to threaten the wider security of the continent.



“No one really knows where President Trump himself will land,” he reflected. “It’s all a matter of the alchemy of the Trump-Putin relationship… It’s all about what goes on in the mind of one man.”

“Today is a day when really all eyes are on Putin. Is he serious about what he says?” he asked.



The Air Force One flight carrying US President Donald Trump has left Joint Base Andrews, bound for Alaska, where he will hold a crucial summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin.



Trump will participate in a bilateral program at 3 p.m. ET and is expected to depart Anchorage back to Washington at 9:45 p.m. ET, according to the White House’s daily guidance.



Russia may have faced a barrage of Western sanctions since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, yet massive military spending and finding new customers for its oil have kept its economy afloat.



Sanctions have targeted Russia’s lucrative energy exports in a bid to squeeze the Kremlin’s finances. The European Union, for example, introduced a ban on seaborne imports of Russian crude oil in late 2022.



Moscow has adapted, re-routing vast quantities of it oil to India and China. Yet US President Donald Trump’s threats to bring in so-called secondary sanctions — additional tariffs placed on buyers of Russian oil — could upend those trading relationships.



India tariffs:Trump hasthreatened to slap a 25% tariffon Indian exports to the US from the end of August as punishment for New Delhi’s trade with Moscow, on top of the 25% levy he imposed last week. India has defended its purchases of Russian oil on the grounds of ensuring energy security for its 1.4 billion-strong population.



But should secondary sanctions eventually pressure buyers of Russian energy to find alternate suppliers, that could deal a significant blow to the Kremlin.



Expectations are high that thesummitbetween US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin could be “dramatic,” CNN chief global affairs correspondent Matthew Chance said, speaking from Alaska.



A potential joint news conference from Trump and Putin — which may or may not be on the cards after their one-on-one meeting — looks set to be an “extraordinary spectacle,” he said.



Chance pointed out that both leaders will go into the meeting with different expectations: Trump will want to focus on bringing an end to the war — something he has pledged to do even prior to taking up his post as US president — while Putin has consistently refused to compromise on his core objectives and wants to take control of all of the Ukrainian territory Russia has annexed.



Putin, Chance said, will also be looking to broaden the agenda during the summit, to discuss commercial issues, space exploration and economic cooperation.



For that reason, the makeup of the Russian delegation includes officials such as Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Chance said.



The large group of advisers US President Donald Trump is bringing with him aboard Air Force One to Alaska could provide a window into the issues up for discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin.



It includes two top economic advisers — Treasury Secretary Scott BessentandCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick— who have been at the center of Trump’s efforts to broker new global trade deals.



While Ukraine is at the center of today’s talks, Russia has said it also wants to discuss improving economic ties. And Putin is also bringing a business delegation in the hopes of turning the discussion to economic matters — and possible business deals.



Bessent’s department is also responsible for enforcing sanctions, while Lutnick’s handles tariffs. Trump has threatened “severe consequences” if Putin doesn’t agree to end the war, including possible secondary sanctions on countries importing Russian oil and gas.



The two advisers most responsible for Trump’s efforts to end the Ukraine war are also aboard:Secretary of State Marco Rubioandspecial envoy Steve Witkoff. Of everyone on the plane, Witkoff is the last to have seen Putin;they met last week in Moscow.



CIA Director John Ratcliffewill also travel with Trump. It wasn’t initially clear whether an intelligence official would join the president for the summit, but his presence indicates the level of sensitive discussion that is expected.



Trump has also brought along his top speechwriter,Ross Worthington— although no speech is planned — and his staff secretary,Will Scharf, who manages the documents Trump signs.



A US official told CNN that “all options remain on the table” during President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, including Trump walking out of the meeting if he does not think Putin is serious about making a deal.



On Thursday, Trump alluded to the possibility while speaking to reporters.



“We’re going to find out where everybody stands, and I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes. We tend to find out whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad meeting, and if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly, and if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace in the pretty near future,” Trump said.



The US official noted that the White House was feeling cautiously optimistic about the meeting, and stressed that Trump felt that he needed to be in the room with Putin to assess where his “head” was in terms of a ceasefire.



US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will start the summit with a one-on-one conversation, with the help of interpreters, before continuing talks over a business lunch, according to the Kremlin.



Large US delegation:The White House announced that 16 officials will travel with the president, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt and US special envoy Steve Witkoff.



It is not clear who among those officials will be in the room with Russia’s representatives. Last week, Witkoff met Putin for talks at the Kremlin, which paved the way for the Alaska summit.



﻿Russia’s other five negotiators will include:Putin’s foreign policy aide Yury Ushakov, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrey Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Kirill Dmitriev, a senior economic negotiator and head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund. The inclusion of officials dealing with economic matters suggests that talking points may go beyond the war.



Notable absence:No officials from Ukraine will be at the summit, despite calls from Kyiv and its European allies for the country to have a seat at the table. Trump has suggested that his goal is to move toward an eventual trilateral meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.



US President Donald Trump departed the White House a short time ago, as he heads to Alaska for a crucial summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.



The motorcade is now rolling to Joint Base Andrews, where Trump will fly on Air Force One to Alaska.



“HIGH STAKES!!!” Trumpposted on Truth Social.



Russia’s Ministry of Defense on Friday claimed its forces had captured the town of Oleksandrohrad in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the key strategic city of Pokrovsk.



Kyiv did not immediately respond to Moscow’s claim, which CNN cannot independently verify.



If confirmed, the capture of Oleksandrohrad would suggest Russia is pressing ahead with its strategy to encircle Pokrovsk, rather than launching a full-frontal assault.



Earlier in the week, Ukrainian officials conceded that Russian forces had infiltrated its increasingly porous frontlines near the town of Dobropillia, east of Pokrovsk, but said this did not mean that Moscow now controlled that territory.



On Thursday, Ukrainian military staff in the region said the situation near Dobropillia had been “stabilized,” and that Ukraine had sealed off the gaps in its defenses, trapping the small groups of Russian forces behind its frontline.



Protesters waving Ukrainian flags lined the streets of Anchorage, Alaska on Thursday ahead ofthe Trump-Putin summit.



Demonstrators reiterated their support for Kyiv as they questioned US President Donald Trump’s ability to negotiate a deal with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, while others said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky should be present at the talks.



Ukrainians rallying outside the US embassy in Kyiv ahead of theTrump-Putin summitcalled for swaps of people, rather than territory swaps, as they expressed feelings of frustration and trepidation.



Around 100 people attended the protest, which came ahead of high-stakes talks between US President Donald Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, demanding that all remaining prisoners are released.



Reporting from the protest, CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman said some of the demonstrators had loved ones who were being held in Russian prisons or had been missing since Moscow occupied Crimea in 2014.



The demonstrators held banners — many of them in English, suggesting they wanted to send a message to the US audience — including one that read “No Land Swap - We Demand PoW Swap for all.”



Organizers also handed in a letter to the embassy, which they hope will be passed on to Trump.



Valentina Vyhinna, 62, joined the protests because her son was taken into Russian captivity fromMariupol’s Azovstal steel plantin May 2022.



“Ukraine needs to be present at the negotiations,” she said. “Trump seems to be walking down a road with two paths — you never know what he will decide. We hope for the best.”



Denys Nerovnyi, 25, was released last month after three years in Russian captivity. “I don’t think Putin and Trump will agree on anything today,” he said.



Another protester, Raisa Kolchena, said some of her relatives are fighting on the front line.



“I think Trump will not help us. He has his own interest,” Kolchena told CNN. “It is very bad that Ukraine is not at the negotiating table. We need to swap people, not swap land.”



The highly-anticipated summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin today is not seen by Ukrainians as a “serious attempt to bring peace,” Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism Lab Nataliya Gumenyuk told CNN.



“There is no sign that the Russian president is willing to stop,” Gumanyuk said, adding that she views one ofPutin’s primary goalsas for the US to “stop any support of Ukraine.”



As for Trump, Gumenyuk said the meeting is seen as an attempt for him to “organize his relations” with Putin.



The Ukrainian journalist continued that Ukrainians cannot ignore the meeting but are not expecting the outcome to be “connected to the end of the war.” They will, however, remain hopeful for any potential deal on the return of prisoners of war.



She added that Ukrainians see an irony to the meeting being held in Alaska, a former Russian colony that was sold to the US in 1867 for $7.2 million.



President Vladimir Putin stopped in Russia’s far eastern region of Magadan while en route to Alaska for his summit with US President Donald Trump on Friday.



Putin is in the city of Magadan for a “full-fledged regional trip,” which includes a visit to an industrial plant and a meeting with the region’s governor, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced earlier today.



“The city is important. Putin has been there many times, even when he was prime minister,” Peskov said, according to state media TASS.



It takes around eight hours to fly from Moscow to Magadan, and then another four from Magadan to Anchorage, Alaska, where the summit is being held.



Due to the time zones Putin is traversing, the Russian president in effect has two Fridays: one in Magadan, with the second to be in Alaska.



US President Donald Trump said he believes Vladimir Putin wants to make peace in Ukraine, and that the Russian president will not “mess around” at their summit today in Alaska.



“We’re gonna find out where everybody stands. And I’ll know within the first two minutes, three minutes, four minutes or five minutes… whether or not we’re going to have a good meeting or a bad,” Trump told reporters in the White House on Thursday.



“And if it’s a bad meeting, it’ll end very quickly. And if it’s a good meeting, we’re going to end up getting peace in the pretty near future,” he warned.



Trump has long claimed that Putin would not have launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 if he had been president, and said Thursday that the war “should have never happened.”



“I think if I weren’t president, he would take over all of Ukraine,” Trump said.



“If I weren’t president, in my opinion, he would much rather take over all of Ukraine. But I am president, and he’s not going to mess around with me.”



Putin has attempted to take all of Ukraine for three-and-a-half years, but has been unable to capture more than around one fifth of its territory, at a cost of more than 1 million Russian casualties, according to the British defense ministry and the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.



The stakes are “very high” for leaders in Europe ahead ofa summitbetween US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, an analyst warned.



Regional lawmakers will watch “from a very anxious distance” later today when Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin convene in Alaska for a high-profile discussion that could change the fate of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.



“For the whole of the European continent, the stakes are very high and the uncertainty immense,” Nigel Gould-Davies, a senior fellow for Russia and Eurasia at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CNN’s Polo Sandoval on Friday.



European politicians who have been entirely iced out of the discussions — including Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky — held avirtual summit with Trumpon Wednesday, to “concert their position” and engage the White House, said Gould-Davies.



“The prospect that Trump and Putin, in relative isolation, could reach an agreement that would fundamentally threaten not only Ukrainian, but wider European security, is a great concern,” he said.



“This is not fundamentally a war in Ukraine about territory,” he reflected. “Russia’s wider ambition is to subordinate the whole of Ukraine (to Russian control) — and then in due course using that as a springboard to threaten the wider security of the continent.



“No one really knows where President Trump himself will land,” he reflected. “It’s all a matter of the alchemy of the Trump-Putin relationship… It’s all about what goes on in the mind of one man.”

## 3. South Korea’s shrinking military

**Link**: [https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/asia/south-north-korea-military-population-decline-intl-hnk](https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/14/asia/south-north-korea-military-population-decline-intl-hnk)

### Content:

The writing has been on the wall for a long time:South Korea’sbirth rate has dropped throughout much of the past decade,spelling trouble for the militaryas regional threats and global conflicts simmer.



Now, a new report has found that the number of South Korean troops declined by 20% in the past six years, in large part because of the dwindling pool of young men – reflecting the shrinking workforce and swelling elderly population in one of theworld’s most rapidly aging countries.



The Defense Ministry report attributed the drop to “complex factors” including population decline and fewer men wanting to become officers due to “soldier treatment.” The report didn’t elaborate on that treatment but studies and surveys have previously highlighted the military’s notoriously harsh conditions.



As of July, the military had 450,000 troops, it said – down from 563,000 in 2019.



“If the number of standing army (members) continues to decline, there can be difficulties in securing elite manpower and limits in operating equipment,” warned the report, shared last week by lawmaker Choo Mi-ae.



The news comes at a bad time for South Korea, a key Western ally which hosts huge numbers of US troops and has a mutual defense treaty with Washington.



Just across the border, neighboring North Korea has senttens of thousands of soldiersto fight for Russia along thefront lines with Ukraine– raising fears that Moscowmay share advanced military technologywith Pyongyang in exchange, violating international sanctions.



Meanwhile, North Korea’s ruling Kim family has continued blasting hostile rhetoric, threatening todestroy South Koreawith nuclear weapons if attacked and warning that Seoul remains“the enemy.”



However, experts say, that doesn’t necessarily mean North Korea’s military is better off.



The North is facing its own population woes and birth rate decline – and its technology lags far behind the South, which is now hoping to plug the shortfall in military recruits through innovation.



“South Korea is incomparably far ahead of North Korea in terms of conventional weapons,” said Choi Byung-ook, a national security professor at Sangmyung University. “We have smaller troops now, but I like to say ‘small but strong military,’ that’s what we need to become.”



On the surface, North Korea has a few advantages.



It’s one of the world’s most heavily militarized nations, with up to 1.3 million armed forces personnel,accordingto the CIA World Factbook. That’s nearly three times higher than South Korea’s troop numbers.



Those troops also serve in the military for far longer – an average of 10 years, which allows them to have higher “unit cohesion (and) knowledge of each other’s capabilities,” said Sydney Seiler, senior adviser to the Korea Chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.



By contrast, there’s “really not much advanced skills that you can develop” within the year and a half that most South Korean conscripts serve, Seiler said.



North Korea’s fertility rate – defined as the average number of children born to a woman in her lifetime – is also far higher, at 1.77 in 2025 compared to South Korea’s rate of 0.75,UN datashows. The North has been having more babies per year than the South since 2018, said Jooyung Lee, senior economist at the Bank of Korea Economic Research Institute.



But the full picture is more complicated, experts told CNN.



For one, South Korea has a reserve force of about 3.1 million men. While their training may be basic, it would give them the numbers needed for potential warfare – and that’s not including the 28,500 US troops stationed in the country.



Pyongyang is also facing its own population problems, with its fertility rate dipping in the last few years after the pandemic. The nation’s authoritarian leader, Kim Jong Un, pointed to the problem at a national conference of mothers in 2023, urging them to “give birth to many children” as a patriotic duty.



That could bode ill for a highly isolated nation with an economy that relies on labor-intensive industries like agriculture and mining, said Lee.



It’s hard to tell how much this has impacted the North Korean military so far. But the fact that Pyongyang has sent tens of thousands of troops to fight for Russia suggests Kim “doesn’t feel concerned about not having enough soldiers on board to do the task of defending the homeland,” Seiler said.



Their military has also enlisted more women to fill whatever gaps do exist. This trend began near the turn of the century after a previous dip in fertility, Lee said, with the proportion of female recruits now reaching as high as 20% by some estimates.



Many are younger women serving in the military’s communications, administrative and anti-aircraft artillery sectors, said Lee, who has interviewed many North Korean refugees who fled the country. Meanwhile, middle-aged and older women have been mobilized to fill gaps in other civilian sectors.



By contrast, women are not conscripted in South Korea – a controversial point that has stoked resentment among some young Korean men who argue their mandatory service puts them at a disadvantage in their studies, careers and personal lives.



As of 2023, volunteer females accounted for only 3.6% of the entire military, according to the Defense Ministry.



Some experts have suggested that conscripting more women could solve South Korea’s problem, which the Defense Ministry has not ruled out. But Choi, the national security professor, argued the country needs to move away from the idea of increasing its manpower – and instead focus on advancing its technology and making the troops elite.



“I don’t personally agree with opinions that we must have a large number of troops because North Korea does,” he said. “The size of our troops has decreased and there are not many options to increase it … I think we need to take this crisis as an opportunity as South Korea is in the route of becoming a science technology powerhouse.”



On thebattlefields of Europe, Ukraine has shown firsthand how an out-manned and out-gunned military can still hold back and inflict painful losses on a much larger opponent by embracingnew and affordable technology.



South Korea’s military has a new enemy: Population math



Tools like drones and cyber-warfare could help decrease South Korea’s reliance on infantry and artillery, Seiler said. AI-assisted and autonomous systems could further boost a shrinking military, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.



Choi pointed out that South Korea spends far more on defense than the North, and conducts many military drills including with allies like the US – making it better equipped in overall combat readiness.



However, Seiler warned, at the end of the day “you still need people. There’s no robots or automation that can replace a trained soldier, airman, marine.” Easley agreed, saying South Korea’s military would still face shortages in manpower in the event of war.



And a broader challenge remains: how do authorities change cultural attitudes toward the military within South Korea?



While people can volunteer to become professional cadres who serve longer terms and train with more advanced weapons, the number of applicants has dropped steadily over the years.



High-profile cases of hazing, bullying and harassment within the South Korean military may have contributed to negative perceptions of the force.



In recent years, the government has loosened restrictions on conscripts – including allowing them to use cell phones at certain times of the day – and offered a longer civilian service alternative to conscription.



But that’s not enough, said Choi.



“We need to improve military welfare and fighting spirits as a whole,” he said – adding that supporting the current size of the military will become even harder in the coming decades as the population declines further.



“By 2040s, even maintaining 350,000 troops will be difficult, and that is why we need to establish an optimized manpower structure system … as soon as possible.”

By contrast, women are not conscripted in South Korea – a controversial point that has stoked resentment among some young Korean men who argue their mandatory service puts them at a disadvantage in their studies, careers and personal lives.



As of 2023, volunteer females accounted for only 3.6% of the entire military, according to the Defense Ministry.



Some experts have suggested that conscripting more women could solve South Korea’s problem, which the Defense Ministry has not ruled out. But Choi, the national security professor, argued the country needs to move away from the idea of increasing its manpower – and instead focus on advancing its technology and making the troops elite.



“I don’t personally agree with opinions that we must have a large number of troops because North Korea does,” he said. “The size of our troops has decreased and there are not many options to increase it … I think we need to take this crisis as an opportunity as South Korea is in the route of becoming a science technology powerhouse.”



On thebattlefields of Europe, Ukraine has shown firsthand how an out-manned and out-gunned military can still hold back and inflict painful losses on a much larger opponent by embracingnew and affordable technology.



South Korea’s military has a new enemy: Population math



Tools like drones and cyber-warfare could help decrease South Korea’s reliance on infantry and artillery, Seiler said. AI-assisted and autonomous systems could further boost a shrinking military, said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.



Choi pointed out that South Korea spends far more on defense than the North, and conducts many military drills including with allies like the US – making it better equipped in overall combat readiness.



However, Seiler warned, at the end of the day “you still need people. There’s no robots or automation that can replace a trained soldier, airman, marine.” Easley agreed, saying South Korea’s military would still face shortages in manpower in the event of war.



And a broader challenge remains: how do authorities change cultural attitudes toward the military within South Korea?



While people can volunteer to become professional cadres who serve longer terms and train with more advanced weapons, the number of applicants has dropped steadily over the years.



High-profile cases of hazing, bullying and harassment within the South Korean military may have contributed to negative perceptions of the force.



In recent years, the government has loosened restrictions on conscripts – including allowing them to use cell phones at certain times of the day – and offered a longer civilian service alternative to conscription.



But that’s not enough, said Choi.



“We need to improve military welfare and fighting spirits as a whole,” he said – adding that supporting the current size of the military will become even harder in the coming decades as the population declines further.



“By 2040s, even maintaining 350,000 troops will be difficult, and that is why we need to establish an optimized manpower structure system … as soon as possible.”

“In one of the bags, I saw a chessboard, and I was interested in the pieces,” she told the BBC.



“I wanted to use the pieces as toys. Instead, my dad said that I could play the game, and then I started from there.”
